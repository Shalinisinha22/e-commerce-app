        We have a "no questions asked return and refund policy" which entitles
        all our members to return the product at the time of delivery if due to
        some reason they are not satisfied with the quality or freshness of the
        product. We will take the returned product back with us and issue a
        credit note for the value of the return products which will be credited
        to your account on the Site. This can be used to pay your subsequent
        shopping bills.
